# GitHub activity viewer

A simple little display of Github activity.

1. Open in GitHub Pages
2. Enter a GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
3. To add your deets, edit `users` in `users.js`
4. To change the start date, edit `from` in `users.js`

Please note: storing access tokens in localStorage is not great from a security point of view, but it saves having to create backend code to access a remote API.
